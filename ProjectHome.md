I observed that too many MediaWiki extensions developers are not using source control for their extensions and they publish them on MediaWiki wiki.

This project aims to improve existing extensions by promoting contributions between extension developers.

Any extension developer (even occasional) should be able to get commit access to the repository. We hope that we'll not have to change this.

To request project membership please send a message to sorin-dot-sbarnea-at-gmail-dot-com and include a link to your current extension or to another extension you want to maintain.
